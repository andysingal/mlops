- To start using a Machine Learning Model, it needs to be effectively deployed into production, so that they can provide predictions to other software systems
- To maximize the value of the Machine Learning Model, we need to be able to reliably extract the predictions and share them with other systems
- Real-time Predictions: Deployed models enable businesses to make real-time predictions or decisions based on new data, facilitating quick responses and proactive decision-making.
- Automation: By integrating models into production systems, businesses can automate processes that rely on data analysis, reducing manual effort and improving operational efficiency.
- Scalability: Model deployment allows organizations to scale their machine learning capabilities to handle large volumes of data and serve multiple users or applications simultaneously.
- Consistency and Reliability: Deployed models ensure consistent and reliable predictions or decisions, minimizing human errors and biases that may arise in manual decision-making.
- Continuous Improvement: Monitoring and updating deployed models enable organizations to continuously improve model performance and adapt to changing business needs.
