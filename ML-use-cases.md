- Fraud detection is among the oldest applications of ML in the enterprise world. If your product or service involves transactions of any value, it’ll be susceptible to fraud. By leveraging ML solutions for anomaly detection, you can have systems that learn from historical fraud transactions and predict whether a future transaction is fraudulent.

- Deciding how much to charge for your product or service is probably one of the hardest business decisions; why not let ML do it for you? Price optimization is the process of estimating a price at a certain time period to maximize a defined objective function, such as the company’s margin, revenue, or growth rate. ML-based pricing optimization is most suitable for cases with a large number of transactions where demand fluctuates and consumers are willing to pay a dynamic price—for example, internet ads, flight tickets, accommodation bookings, ride-sharing, and events.
